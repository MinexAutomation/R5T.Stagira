R5T.Stagira - A code-named types library for the TypedString type that allows strong-typing of strings.

Built on work from R5T.NetStandard.TypedString.

This code-named project was created to allow separation of the concept of a typed-string from a specific implementation. The already existing R5T.NetStandard.TypedString project purported to be *THE* definitive implementation of the typed-string concept, but that may not be the case. This project reduces the risk of taking a dependency on a typed-string library by providing a code-name (meaning the library could be switched out for any other code-named library offering typed-string functionality). The projecct does NOT reduce the risk as much as just defining an interface in a base library would, but, the whole IDEA of typing strings is to allow leveraging the static type system. So you need at least one actual concrete type.

Not sure how to navigate reducing code duplication with a Typed<T> base class (which could share equality checking code, for example, with TypedInt, and TypedDouble).
